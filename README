                         |   PoorMan's DataStore   |
                         -=========================-

Preface -

    Yes I'm a Freetard, and my crime is of having a leecher's mentality. Maybe
    I don't have the same attitude towards a penny in my hand, or anything that
    has to do with the real world. But when it comes to something that is free
    or even partially free and is something awesome, yes I admit I would love to
    leech it more. PoorMan's DataStore is an expression of such desires.
    Put simply, the desire of not having to invest. But that's a lie, you see
    investment not always has to do with money, it includes time and energy too.


Purpose -

    To allow people to use google appengine's DataStore in a distributed way,
    so as to be able to store more than a gigabyte of data - the current quota
    on free users.
    
    To provide an API so that anyone can easily configure, reuse and hack ahead.
    
    To demonstrate the above mentioned purpose with help of a live example that
    utilizes the PoorMan API

Definitions -

    Slave -

        This is an appengine app, whose sole purpose is to store the data given
        to it, give information about number of bytes stored in its DataStore,
        to delete/modify/serve data when asked to. It would also take care of
        the mimetypes and server content appropriately.
        
    Master -
    
        This where you utilize the PoorMan API to store or retrieve data on
        Slaves.
        This is also where your webapp resides. The PoorMan API and your app
        have a symbiotic relationship.
